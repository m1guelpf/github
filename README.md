# LaraGit
A Laravel interface for managing Github notifications.

## Introduction:

LaraGit was created as a personal project for learning Laravel, PHP and the Github API. This means that, when I started it, I didn't know anything about Laravel. They're probably lot's of things to improve, and I'm still learning. If you find one, please [open an issue](https://github.com/m1guelpf/github/issues/new) or [make a pull request](https://github.com/m1guelpf/github/pulls/compare).

## Features:

- Multi-user support: You can add all the users you want. In fact, anyone with a Github account can use it if you expose it on the internet!
- Uses Github Style: LaraGit uses [PrimeCSS](http://primercss.io/) and [Octicons](https://octicons.github.com) for having a github-like style!
- Caching: LaraGit uses notification caching to reduce load time and provide you an awesome experience!
- More coming soon: LaraGit is under active developement so, if you want to help or have ideas, go ahead and Contribute!
